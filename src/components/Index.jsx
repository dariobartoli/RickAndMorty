              Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science-fiction
              sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon
              Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. It is
              distributed internationally by Warner Bros. Television
              Distribution. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad
              scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson
              Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and
              interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite
              number of realities, often travelling to other planets and
              dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer. The
              general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting
              scenarios: domestic family drama, and an alcoholic grandfather
              dragging his grandson into hijinks.

              Roiland voiced the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell,
              Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and
              Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short
              parody film of Back to the Future created by Roiland for Channel
              101, a short-film festival cofounded by Harmon. Since its debut,
              the series has received critical acclaim for its originality,
              creativity, and humor. It has been nominated for three Primetime
              Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and won the award in
              2018 and 2020. The series has also received two Annie Awards. The
              series has several times been the most viewed television comedy
              for adults. The popularity of Rick and Morty has made it a
              hundred-million dollar merchandising and media franchise.

              The sixth season premiered on September 4, 2022, and consists of
              ten episodes. A seventh season was confirmed as part of a
              long-term deal with Cartoon Network that ordered 70 new episodes,
              which renewed the series through to a tenth season. Adult Swim cut
              ties with Roiland in January 2023 amid allegations of abuse and
              announced it would be recasting his parts.
